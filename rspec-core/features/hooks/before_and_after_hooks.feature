Feature: before and after hooks

  As a developer using RSpec
  I want to execute arbitrary code before and after each example
  So that I can control the environment in which it is run

    This is supported by the before and after methods which each take a symbol
    indicating the scope, and a block of code to execute.

    before(:each) blocks are run before each example
    before(:all) blocks are run once before all of the examples in a group

    after(:each) blocks are run after each example
    after(:all) blocks are run once after all of the examples in a group

    Before and after blocks are called in the following order:
      before all
      before each
      after each
      after all

    Before and after blocks can be defined in the example groups to which they
    apply or in a configuration. When defined in a configuration, they can be
    applied to all groups or subsets of all groups defined by example group
    types.
