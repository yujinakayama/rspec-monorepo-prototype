### RSpec Core

* support the following concepts from rspec-1.2.x
  * run options
    * from command line
    * in rake task definitions
  * formatters

* For self testing
** shared example groups should not be merged into the real 'world'

### Maxwell

* need to figure out how maxwell will allow us to mix all the rails testing
  facilities with rspec when working with rails.
