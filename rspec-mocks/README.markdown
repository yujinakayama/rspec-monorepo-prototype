# RSpec Mocks

rspec-mocks provides a test-double framework for rspec including support
for method stubs, fakes, and message expectations.

rspec-mocks is currently in alpha release. While you are welcome to
track, fork, explore, etc, we're too early in the process to start fielding
pull requests and or issues from outside the core development team, so please
don't waste your time until this notice changes.

## Install

    [sudo] gem install rspec --prerelease

This will install rspec, rspec-core, rspec-expectations and rspec-mocks.
