### Testing GFM

This is here temporarily to test github-flavored-markdown on rubydoc.info.

### Example 1 (this one should work)

<pre>
```ruby
thing = Thing.new
thing.should do_something
```
</pre>

```ruby
thing = Thing.new
thing.should do_something
```

### Example 2 (indented 2 spaces - just to see what happens)

<pre>
  ```ruby
  thing = Thing.new
  thing.should do_something
  ```
</pre>

  ```ruby
  thing = Thing.new
  thing.should do_something
  ```

### Example 4 (indented 4 spaces - just to see what happens)

<pre>
    ```ruby
    thing = Thing.new
    thing.should do_something
    ```
</pre>

    ```ruby
    thing = Thing.new
    thing.should do_something
    ```
